1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage:
   when the problem happened, if multi-AZ configuration is available, AWS fails over to a standby in a different AZ automatically, it can take a few minutes.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
  - 00:00 - Problem happened (0 minutes) 
  - 00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes) 
  - 00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute) 
  - 00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes) 
  - 00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes) 
  - 00:36 - Root cause is discovered (10 minutes) 
  - 00:41 - Remediation started (5 minutes)
  - 00:51 - Remediation completed (10 minutes) 
 => Total time: 51 minutes

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
if multi-AZ configuration is available, we still have a standby database, data loss will be minimal

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage 
The RPO will be  depend on how often data is backed up. In case we store a new backup every 1 hour then the minimum RPO will be 1 hour
